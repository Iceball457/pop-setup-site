        <h1>Pop!_OS Developer Setup</h1>
        <h2>The Dangers of the Pop!_Shop</h2>
        <p>
            The Pop Shop is a neat little gui for installing packages with apt and/or flatpak; however, all packages installed with the Pop Shop are put into a secure sandbox that <i>does not interact</i> with the rest of the operating system.<br>
            This is great for system security, as no applications installed with the Pop Shop can do anything with/to your operating system! This is awful for developing, as no applications installed with the Pop Shop can do anything with/to your operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is most notable when using IDEs, as they will not have access to any command line packages on your PATH. IntelliJ's IDEs suffer the most here.<br>
            Unity suffers in another way, related to the fact that dotnet is <i>not available</i> on the Pop Shop. If you install the Shop's version of unity, it will ask you to install Visual Studio Code and dotnet. Of course, you need dotnet and mono to develop in C#. Once you have installed dotnet and mono, VSCode will still throw a fit about not seeing them! How rude!
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution is simple, of course: just avoid the Pop Shop when installing development software (up until the point this issue gets fixed: I recommend a secure vs trusted toggle). And the rest of this page is dedicated to the commands I found on this journey of linux discovery.

        <h2>dependency issue</h2>
        Pop!_OS does not come with a repo that contains the very necessary <a href="https://debian.pkgs.org/11/debian-main-amd64/libssl1.1_1.1.1n-0+deb11u1_amd64.deb.html">libssl1.1</a>. I could not find the public key that lets you access the linked repo from apt, but if necessary you should be able to download it from the link and install via eddy. This is not recommended if you can avoid it!
